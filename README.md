# Raytracing

- Raytracer simulate light rays to render a 3D scene.

- The scene contains one camera and many triangles
- We only use one triangle
- We can convert more complex shaspes into triangles in a process called triangulation, but we will not do that here
- A triangle consists of three coordinates in 3D space
- The camera is also located in 3D space, where it has a position and a direction
- The camera is special as it # py-raytracer
